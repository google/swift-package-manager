# Purpose

This repository exists to allow Googlers to collaborate and stage pull requests
against the official Swift repository.

# Contributing

We strongly encourage contributors to contribute directly to upstream whenever
possible; contributions will be rejected if the project owners feel they are
more appropriate for a direct upstream contribution.

If you would like to contribute to this repository, there are a few steps to
follow:

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your
current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you‘ve already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don’t need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more
information on using pull requests.

## Upstream Policies

All contributions to this repository are expected to go upstream; please make
